# Overview
gemlaunch.fun is a web platform for creating and launching memecoins on the Kaspa blockchain. It offers a no-code solution with an emphasis on fair launch mechanisms and community-driven tokens, leveraging Kaspa's high-performance L1 capabilities. The platform includes an AI Assistant (Gemmy), a social layer, a gamified leaderboard, and integrates with Kaspa Finance for DEX deployments. Its purpose is to democratize memecoin creation and foster a vibrant Kaspa ecosystem.

# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Design Preferences
- **Button Style**: Sleek rectangular buttons with rounded corners (border-radius: 10px). NEVER use oval/pill-shaped buttons (border-radius: 25px+)

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend uses Flask and Jinja2 for server-side rendering, a custom CSS framework (Grid, Flexbox, animations), and vanilla JavaScript. It incorporates particles.js and a GitBook-style tabbed documentation system, with a responsive and mobile-first design.

## Backend Architecture
Built with Flask, the backend features a minimal, route-based architecture with environment-based configuration, Python logging, and XSS protection. It includes an achievement system and interactive AI suggestions from Gemmy that auto-fill forms.

### AI Features
- **Gemmy Zeroday Memification Engine**: An AI-powered trend discovery system using OpenRouter API for multi-source cultural trend detection and Kaspa Tech analysis, with auto-failover, parallel processing, and a PostgreSQL cache.
- **AI Token Image Generation**: A two-stage AI pipeline uses OpenRouter Llama 3.1 70B for prompt enhancement and Replicate FLUX.1 Schnell for 1024x1024 WebP image generation.

### Core Features
- **PRO Token Airdrop System**: Manages airdrops with a 5% per day vesting schedule and various distribution types.
- **Anti-Bot System (GEM System)**: An optional premium feature for PRO tokens using time-based KAS fee decay to prevent bot sniping.
- **Token-Specific Community Points System**: Allows PRO token creators to configure and track engagement points.
- **Multi-Wallet Linking System**: Securely links multiple wallets via challenge-response authentication.
- **Wallet Connection System**: A modal-based system supporting Kastle, KasWare, and MetaMask using challenge-response authentication.
- **Enhanced Marketplace Search**: Provides comprehensive search across token name, symbol, contract address, and creator information with real-time, case-insensitive matching.

## Smart Contract Architecture
Core contracts (`BondingCurvePool.sol`, `TokenFactory.sol`, `GraduationController.sol`) manage token creation, bonding curve mechanics, creator fee claims, anti-bot measures (wallet cap), and a two-step graduation process for transitioning tokens to the Kaspa Finance DEX. An off-chain backend service calculates auto-slippage.

## Database Schema
The `Token` model includes blockchain integration fields like `creator_fees_accumulated`, `deployment_block_number`, `nft_position_id`, and `liquidity_pool_address`. New models include `TradeEvent` and `AntiBotFeeTracker` for storing blockchain trade events and anti-bot fee distributions, with extensive indexing.

## Design Patterns
The project adheres to an MVC pattern, separating templates (views), Flask routes (controllers), and models.

## Performance Optimizations
Includes hardware-accelerated CSS animations, efficient asset caching, and JavaScript-enhanced smooth scrolling.

## Blockchain Integration Foundation
The system includes a Web3 Service Layer for RPC connection to Kasplex zkEVM L2 (Testnet), an Oracle Wallet for automated operations, and contract loading for `TokenFactory`, `GraduationController`, and `BondingCurvePool`. Transaction utilities handle gas estimation, signing, relay, and status polling, with POA middleware for Kasplex compatibility.

## Transaction Flow Architecture
Transactions follow a 5-phase lifecycle: Quote → Build → Sign → Relay → Monitor. User signs transactions in their wallet, and the backend relays them to the blockchain. Oracle transactions are signed and relayed by the backend for automated operations.

## Transaction Manager Module
A dedicated `static/js/transaction_manager.js` module orchestrates all transaction types (token creation, buy, sell, claim fees) by integrating wallet management with backend APIs.
